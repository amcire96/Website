          <h2>About Me</h2>
	    <p>
On April 2nd, 1996, I was born in the Mcgill University hospital in Montreal, Canada. I spent my first four years of my life living in Montreal, though I don't remember much of that time. In the year 2000, my family moved from Canada to the United States. I lived a year in Boxborough, Massachusetts before moving to Acton, Massachusetts where I happily currently reside with my two parents and sister. Growing up in Acton has been a great experience. I have grown up with so many terrific friends supporting me throughout all the tough times. Many of my neighborhood friends have been my friends since I moved here! I've also met so many amazing people as years have gone by including my awesome girlfriend Anni! The public high school here, Acton Boxborough Regional High School, is very academically rigorous, but I also had the time to spend time on extracurriculars and with friends. Hopefully I can take this skill of managing time to college!</p>  

	    <p>But enough with the distant past. Senior year of high school was a very exciting time, especially one special day in early November. On that day, I found out that my early decision application to Cornell University's College of Engineering had been accepted! On June 6th of 2014, I graduated from Acton Boxborough Regional High School, officially ending my high school career and kickstarting my college one. At Cornell, I plan to major in computer science and play some form of intramural/club volleyball. I am extremely excited to go off to Ithaca albeit a little nervous. </p>
